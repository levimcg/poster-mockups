# Poster Mockups
A simple poster mockup that makes use of vector smart objects for use in your web portfolio

## About
I often time find myself needing simple poster mockup for use on the web. It always felt awkward to me to stick a full-width portrait orientation image in a main content column of a website. If you want the image to take up the full width of the column, the image ends up being so tall that most people wouldn't even be able to see the entire image without scrolling.

I saw [this](https://github.com/blog/1845-psd-viewing-diffing) article on the Github blog the other day, so I thought it would be fun to take advantage of this cool new feature. It's a rough start, so by all means fork it and make it better.
